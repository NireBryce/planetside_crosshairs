Guess-and-check projectile drop crosshair images for Recursion Tracker

## TODO:
- fix folder structure
- change names

## Description:
This is meant to be used with the crosshair overlay module for https://recursiontracker.com/

Place wherever you place your own crosshairs, then use the crosshair mod options to select it.

It gives you a mechanism for trial-and-error drop compensation/[Kentucky Windage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windage#Ballistics)

These aren't calibrated for any weapon or any range, as that would require needing one per FOV.

I only have a 1080p monitor, so I have a feeling all higher resolutions will be offset slightly compared to the in-game crosshair (which on 1080p, is inexplicably down and to the left, you can verify this with either the dart gun or the VS' horizon weapon, which has a pinpoint crosshair when standing still.  To fix it (and ideally submit the fixed version here), take a screenshot, then overlay the crosshair as a layer and move it to the correct position.  Alternatively, you can send me the screenshot and I can do that.

A lot of people can estimate this based on their muscle memory, this evens the playing field and also allows me personally to reduce cognitive load because I can just go 'ok, thumper's hitting, I just have to hold at 5 to hit the same spot'.  

You can call that cheating, but I don't see how it is any more than the monitors or programs which can give you a mildot crosshair, and because those exist and can't be checked for, this needs to too or people without those cannot compete at a similar level.
