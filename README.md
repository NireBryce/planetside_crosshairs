Guess-and-check projectile drop crosshair images for Recursion Tracker

## TODO:
- fix folder structure
- change names

## Description:
This is meant to be used with the crosshair overlay module for https://recursiontracker.com/

Finding the crosshair path and where to put it is in the Installation section below.

It gives you a mechanism for trial-and-error drop compensation/[Kentucky Windage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windage#Ballistics)

These aren't calibrated for any weapon or any range, as that would require needing one per FOV.

The way I use this is basically for memory of how high a hold I needed to use, 'okay, to hit people that far away from here I need to keep resetting the thumper to the 5 mark, not just ride recoil'

A lot of people can estimate this based on their muscle memory, this evens the playing field and also allows me personally to reduce cognitive load of having to focus on what angle I'm aiming if its above the in-game compensation reticle.

You can call that cheating, but I don't see how it is any more than the monitors or programs which can give you a mildot crosshair, and because those exist and can't be checked for, this needs to too or people without those cannot compete at a similar level.

### Potential Bugs:

I only have a 1080p monitor, so I have a feeling all higher resolutions will be offset slightly compared to the in-game crosshair (which on 1080p, is inexplicably down and to the left, you can verify this with either the dart gun or the VS' horizon weapon, which has a pinpoint crosshair when standing still.  To fix it (and ideally submit the fixed version here), take a screenshot, then overlay the crosshair as a layer and move it to the correct position.  Alternatively, you can send me the screenshot and I can do that.
